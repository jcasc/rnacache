SYNOPSIS

    rnacache modify <database> <sequence file/directory>... [OPTION]...

    rnacache modify <database> [OPTION]... <sequence file/directory>...


DESCRIPTION

    Add reference sequence to an existing database.


REQUIRED PARAMETERS

    <database>        database file name;
                      An RNACache database contains min-hash signatures of
                      reference sequences.

    <sequence file/directory>...
                      FASTA or FASTQ files containing transcriptomic sequences.
                      If directory names are given, they will be searched for
                      sequence files (at most 10 levels deep).



BASIC OPTIONS

    -taxonomy <path>  Unavailable in RNACache.

    -taxpostmap <file>
                      Unavailable in RNACache.

    -silent|-verbose  information level during build:
                      silent => none / verbose => most detailed
                      default: neither => only errors/important info


ADVANCED OPTIONS

    -reset-taxa       Unavailable in RNACache.
                      default: off

    -max-locations-per-feature <#>
                      maximum number of reference sequence locations to be
                      stored per feature;
                      If the value is too high it will significantly impact
                      querying speed. Note that an upper hard limit is always
                      imposed by the data type used for the hash table bucket
                      size (set with compilation macro
                      '-DMC_LOCATION_LIST_SIZE_TYPE').
                      default: 254

    -remove-overpopulated-features
                      Removes all features that have reached the maximum allowed
                      amount of locations per feature. This can improve querying
                      speed and can be used to remove non-discriminative
                      features.
                      default: on

    -remove-ambig-features <rank>
                      Removes all features that have more distinct reference
                      sequence on the given taxonomic rank than set by
                      '-max-ambig-per-feature'. This can decrease the database
                      size significantly at the expense of sensitivity. Note
                      that the lower the given taxonomic rank is, the more
                      pronounced the effect will be.
                      Valid values: sequence, form, variety, subspecies,
                      species, subgenus, genus, subtribe, tribe, subfamily,
                      family, suborder, order, subclass, class, subphylum,
                      phylum, subkingdom, kingdom, domain
                      default: off

    -max-ambig-per-feature <#>
                      Maximum number of allowed different reference sequence
                      taxa per feature if option '-remove-ambig-features' is
                      used.

    -max-load-fac <factor>
                      maximum hash table load factor;
                      This can be used to trade off larger memory consumption
                      for speed and vice versa. A lower load factor will improve
                      speed, a larger one will improve memory efficiency.
                      default: 0.800000


EXAMPLES
    Add reference sequence 'added.fa' to database 'transcripts'
        rnacache modify transcripts added.fa
