SYNOPSIS

    rnacache modify <database> <sequence file/directory>... [OPTION]...

    rnacache modify <database> [OPTION]... <sequence file/directory>...


DESCRIPTION

    Add reference sequence to an existing database.


REQUIRED PARAMETERS

    <database>        database file name;
                      An RNACache database contains min-hash signatures of
                      reference sequences.

    <sequence file/directory>...
                      FASTA or FASTQ files containing transcriptomic sequences.
                      If directory names are given, they will be searched for
                      sequence files (at most 10 levels deep).



-silent|-verbose      BASIC OPTIONS


ADVANCED OPTIONS

    -max-locations-per-feature <#>
                      maximum number of reference sequence locations to be
                      stored per feature;
                      If the value is too high it will significantly impact
                      querying speed. Note that an upper hard limit is always
                      imposed by the data type used for the hash table bucket
                      size (set with compilation macro
                      '-DMC_LOCATION_LIST_SIZE_TYPE').Can also be set in query
                      mode.
                      default: 254

    -remove-overpopulated-features
                      Removes all features that have reached the maximum allowed
                      amount of locations per feature. This can improve querying
                      speed and can be used to remove non-discriminative
                      features.Can also be set in query mode.
                      default: on

    -max-ambig-per-feature <#>
                      Maximum number of allowed different reference sequences
                      per feature. Removes all features exceeding this limit
                      from database.
                      default: off

    -max-load-fac <factor>
                      maximum hash table load factor;
                      This can be used to trade off larger memory consumption
                      for speed and vice versa. A lower load factor will improve
                      speed, a larger one will improve memory efficiency.
                      default: 0.800000


EXAMPLES
    Add reference sequence 'added.fa' to database 'transcripts'
        rnacache modify transcripts added.fa
