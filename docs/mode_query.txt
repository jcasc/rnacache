SYNOPSIS

    rnacache query <database>

    rnacache query <database> <sequence file/directory>... [OPTION]...

    rnacache query <database> [OPTION]... <sequence file/directory>...


DESCRIPTION

    Map sequences (short reads, long reads, ...)
    to their most likely reference sequences of origin.


BASIC PARAMETERS

    <database>        database file name;
                      An RNACache database contains min-hash signatures of
                      reference sequences.

    <sequence file/directory>...
                      FASTA or FASTQ files containing transcriptomic sequences
                      (short reads, long reads, ...) that shall be classified.
                      * If directory names are given, they will be searched for
                      sequence files (at most 10 levels deep).
                      * If no input filenames or directories are given, RNACache
                      will run in interactive query mode. This can be used to
                      load the database into memory only once and then query it
                      multiple times with different query options. 


-out <file>           Redirect output to file <file>.
                      If not specified, output will be written to stdout. If
                      more than one input file was given all output will be
                      concatenated into one file.


-sam                  Generate output in SAM format instead of RNACache's
                      default format. 


-with-sam-out <file>  Generates SAM format output in addition to default output.
                      Output is redirected to <file>.


-with-bam-out <file>  Generates BAM format output in addition to default output.
                      Output is redirected to <file>.


PAIRED-END READ HANDLING

    -pairfiles        Interleave paired-end reads from two consecutive files, so
                      that the nth read from file m and the nth read from file
                      m+1 will be treated as a pair. If more than two files are
                      provided, their names will be sorted before processing.
                      Thus, the order defined by the filenames determines the
                      pairing not the order in which they were given in the
                      command line.


    -pairseq          Two consecutive sequences (1+2, 3+4, ...) from each file
                      will be treated as paired-end reads.


    -insertsize <#>   Maximum insert size to consider.
                      default: sum of lengths of the individual reads


CLASSIFICATION

    -hitmin <t>       Sets classification threshold 't^min' to <t>.
                      All candidates with fewer hits are discarded from the
                      query's candidate set.
                      default: 4

    -maxcand <#>      Has no effect. (Requires selection of
                      best_distinct_matches_... candidate generator in
                      config.h).


    -hit-cutoff <t>   Sets classification threshhold 't^cutoff' to <t>.
                      All candidates with fewer hits (relative to the maximal
                      candidate) are discarded from the query's candidate set.
                      default: 0.800000

    -cov-min <p>      Sets classification coverage threshold 't^cov' to <t>
                      Candidates on targets with lower coverage will be
                      discarded.
                      default: 0.900000

    -align            Enables post-mapping alignment step and filters candidates
                      accordingly. Candidates are only aligned during mapping
                      phase, not during coverage phase. Alignments are only
                      shown in SAM / BAM output modes.
                      DRASTICALLY increases runtime!
                      default: -1

    -max-edit <t>     Maximum allowed edit distance of alignments (enables
                      -align). Alignments with higher edit distance will not be
                      considered. Higher values drastically increase runtime! -1
                      = unlimited
                      default: -1

    -no-cov-norm      Disable max norm of coverage statistic.
                      default: disabled

    -fill-coverage    Include caps in candidates' contiguous window ranges in
                      coverage. Waves 2nd coverage condition (see paper).
                      default: disabled


GENERAL OUTPUT FORMATTING

    -no-summary       Dont't show result summary & mapping statistics at the end
                      of the mapping output
                      default: off

    -no-query-params  Don't show query settings at the beginning of the mapping
                      output
                      default: off

    -no-err           Suppress all error messages.
                      default: off


CLASSIFICATION RESULT FORMATTING

    -no-default       Don't show default mapping output for each individual
                      query. show summaries and / or alternative output
                      (SAM/BAM).
                      default: off

    -mapped-only      Don't list unclassified reads/read pairs.
                      default: off

    -tgtids           Print target ids in addition to target names.
                      default: off

    -tgtids-only      Print target ids instead of target names.
                      default: off

    -separator <text> Sets string that separates output columns.
                      default: '\t|\t'

    -comment <text>   Sets string that precedes comment (non-mapping) lines.
                      default: '# '

    -queryids         Show a unique id for each query.
                      Note that in paired-end mode a query is a pair of two read
                      sequences.
                      default: off


ANALYSIS: RAW DATABASE HITS

    -allhits          For each query, print all feature hits in database.
                      default: off

    -locations        Show locations in candidate reference sequences.
                      default: off


ADVANCED: GROUND TRUTH BASED EVALUATION

    -ground-truth     Report correct query taxa if known.
                      Queries need to have either a 'tgtid|<number>' entry in
                      their header or a sequence id that is also present in the
                      database.
                      This feature decreases querying speed!
                      default: off

    -statistics       Report mapping statistics such as number of hits per read.
                      See: -accuracy for more stats.
                      default: off

    -accuracy         Report accuracy statistics by comparing query origins
                      (ground truth) and mappings.
                      Queries need to have either a 'tgtid|<number>' entry in
                      their header or a sequence id that is also found in the
                      database. Equivalent to -ground-truth -statistics
                      This feature might decrease querying speed!
                      default: off


ADVANCED: CUSTOM QUERY SKETCHING (SUBSAMPLING)

    -kmerlen <k>      number of nucleotides/characters in a k-mer
                      default: determined by database

    -sketchlen <s>    number of features (k-mer hashes) per sampling window
                      default: determined by database

    -winlen <w>       number of letters in each sampling window
                      default: determined by database

    -winstride <l>    distance between window starting positions
                      default: determined by database


ADVANCED: DATABASE MODIFICATION

    -max-locations-per-feature <#>
                      maximum number of reference sequence locations to be
                      stored per feature;
                      If the value is too high it will significantly impact
                      querying speed. Note that an upper hard limit is always
                      imposed by the data type used for the hash table bucket
                      size (set with compilation macro
                      '-DMC_LOCATION_LIST_SIZE_TYPE').Can also be set in query
                      mode.
                      default: 254

    -remove-overpopulated-features
                      Removes all features that have reached the maximum allowed
                      amount of locations per feature. This can improve querying
                      speed and can be used to remove non-discriminative
                      features.Can also be set in query mode.
                      default: on

    -max-ambig-per-feature <#>
                      Maximum number of allowed different reference sequences
                      per feature. Removes all features exceeding this limit
                      from database.
                      default: off

    -max-load-fac <factor>
                      maximum hash table load factor;
                      This can be used to trade off larger memory consumption
                      for speed and vice versa. A lower load factor will improve
                      speed, a larger one will improve memory efficiency.
                      default: 0.800000


ADVANCED: PERFORMANCE TUNING / TESTING

    -threads <#>      Sets the maximum number of parallel threads to use.
                      default (on this machine): 16

    -bam-threads <#>  Sets the maximum number of parallel thread to use for BAM
                      processing. (In addition to threads of -threads parameter.
                      default: 16

    -batch-size <#>   Process <#> many queries (reads or read pairs) per thread
                      at once.
                      default (on this machine): 4096

    -bam-buffer <t>   Sets pre-allocated size of buffer for BAM processing to
                      2^<t>.
                      default: 33554432

    -query-limit <#>  Classify at max. <#> queries (reads or read pairs) per
                      input file.
                      default: 9223372036854775807


EXAMPLES

    Query all sequences in 'myreads.fna' against pre-built database 'refseq':
        rnacache query refseq myreads.fna -out results.txt

    Query all sequences in multiple files against database 'refseq':
        rnacache query refseq reads1.fna reads2.fna reads3.fna

    Query all sequence files in folder 'test' againgst database 'refseq':
        rnacache query refseq test

    Query multiple files and folder contents against database 'refseq':
        rnacache query refseq file1.fna folder1 file2.fna file3.fna folder2

    Load database in interactive query mode, then query multiple read batches
        rnacache query refseq
        reads1.fa reads2.fa -pairfiles -insertsize 400
        reads3.fa -pairseq -insertsize 300


OUTPUT FORMAT

    RNACache's default read mapping output format is:
    read_header | seq_name

    Note that the separator '\t|\t' can be changed to something else with
    the command line option '-separator <text>'.
