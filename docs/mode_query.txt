SYNOPSIS

    rnacache query <database>

    rnacache query <database> <sequence file/directory>... [OPTION]...

    rnacache query <database> [OPTION]... <sequence file/directory>...


DESCRIPTION

    Map sequences (short reads, long reads, ...)
    to their most likely reference sequence of origin.


BASIC PARAMETERS

    <database>        database file name;
                      An RNACache database contains min-hash signatures of
                      reference sequences.

    <sequence file/directory>...
                      FASTA or FASTQ files containing transcriptomic sequences
                      (short reads, long reads, ...) that shall be classified.
                      * If directory names are given, they will be searched for
                      sequence files (at most 10 levels deep).
                      * If no input filenames or directories are given, RNACache
                      will run in interactive query mode. This can be used to
                      load the database into memory only once and then query it
                      multiple times with different query options. 


MAPPING RESULTS OUTPUT

    -out <file>       Redirect output to file <file>.
                      If not specified, output will be written to stdout. If
                      more than one input file was given all output will be
                      concatenated into one file.


    -split-out <file> Generate output and statistics for each input file
                      separately. For each input file <in> an output file with
                      name <file>_<in> will be written.


PAIRED-END READ HANDLING

    -pairfiles        Interleave paired-end reads from two consecutive files, so
                      that the nth read from file m and the nth read from file
                      m+1 will be treated as a pair. If more than two files are
                      provided, their names will be sorted before processing.
                      Thus, the order defined by the filenames determines the
                      pairing not the order in which they were given in the
                      command line.


    -pairseq          Two consecutive sequences (1+2, 3+4, ...) from each file
                      will be treated as paired-end reads.


    -insertsize <#>   Maximum insert size to consider.
                      default: sum of lengths of the individual reads


CLASSIFICATION

    -hitmin <t>       Sets classification threshhold to <t>.
                      A read will not be classified if less than t features from
                      the database match. Higher values will increase precision
                      at the expense of sensitivity.
                      default: 4

    -maxcand <#>      (Requires changes in config.h)


GENERAL OUTPUT FORMATTING

    -no-summary       Dont't show result summary & mapping statistics at the end
                      of the mapping output
                      default: off

    -no-query-params  Don't show query settings at the beginning of the mapping
                      output
                      default: off

    -no-err           Suppress all error messages.
                      default: off


CLASSIFICATION RESULT FORMATTING

    -no-map           Don't report classification for each individual query
                      sequence; show summaries only (useful for quick tests).
                      default: off

    -mapped-only      Don't list unclassified reads/read pairs.
                      default: off

    -taxids           Print taxon ids in addition to taxon names.
                      default: off

    -taxids-only      Print taxon ids instead of taxon names.
                      default: off

    -omit-ranks       Do not print taxon rank names.
                      default: on

    -separate-cols    Prints *all* mapping information (rank, taxon name, taxon
                      ids) in separate columns (see option '-separator').
                      default: off

    -separator <text> Sets string that separates output columns.
                      default: '\t|\t'

    -comment <text>   Sets string that precedes comment (non-mapping) lines.
                      default: '# '

    -queryids         Show a unique id for each query.
                      Note that in paired-end mode a query is a pair of two read
                      sequences. This option will always be activated if option
                      '-hits-per-seq' is given.
                      default: off


ANALYSIS: ABUNDANCES

    -abundances <file>
                      Show absolute and relative abundance of each taxon.
                      If a valid filename is given, the list will be written to
                      this file.
                      default: off

    -abundance-per <rank>
                      Show absolute and relative abundances for each taxon on
                      one specific rank.
                      Classifications on higher ranks will be estimated by
                      distributing them down according to the relative
                      abundances of classifications on or below the given rank.
                      (Valid values: sequence, form, variety, subspecies,
                      species, subgenus, genus, subtribe, tribe, subfamily,
                      family, suborder, order, subclass, class, subphylum,
                      phylum, subkingdom, kingdom, domain)
                      If '-abundances <file>' was given, this list will be
                      printed to the same file.
                      default: off


ANALYSIS: RAW DATABASE HITS

    -allhits          For each query, print all feature hits in database.
                      default: off

    -locations        Show locations in candidate reference sequences.
                      Activates option '-tophits'.
                      default: off


ANALYSIS: ALIGNMENTS

    -align            Show semi-global alignment to best candidate reference
                      sequence.
                      Original files of reference sequences must be available.
                      This feature decreases the querying speed!
                      default: off


ADVANCED: GROUND TRUTH BASED EVALUATION

    -ground-truth     Report correct query taxa if known.
                      Queries need to have either a 'taxid|<number>' entry in
                      their header or a sequence id that is also present in the
                      database.
                      This feature decreases the querying speed!
                      default: off

    -precision        Report precision & sensitivity by comparing query taxa
                      (ground truth) and mapped taxa.
                      Queries need to have either a 'taxid|<number>' entry in
                      their header or a sequence id that is also found in the
                      database.
                      This feature decreases the querying speed!
                      default: off

    -taxon-coverage   Report true/false positives and true/false negatives.This
                      option turns on '-precision', so ground truth data needs
                      to be available.
                      This feature decreases the querying speed!
                      default: off


ADVANCED: CUSTOM QUERY SKETCHING (SUBSAMPLING)

    -kmerlen <k>      number of nucleotides/characters in a k-mer
                      default: determined by database

    -sketchlen <s>    number of features (k-mer hashes) per sampling window
                      default: determined by database

    -winlen <w>       number of letters in each sampling window
                      default: determined by database

    -winstride <l>    distance between window starting positions
                      default: determined by database


ADVANCED: DATABASE MODIFICATION

    -max-locations-per-feature <#>
                      maximum number of reference sequence locations to be
                      stored per feature;
                      If the value is too high it will significantly impact
                      querying speed. Note that an upper hard limit is always
                      imposed by the data type used for the hash table bucket
                      size (set with compilation macro
                      '-DMC_LOCATION_LIST_SIZE_TYPE').
                      default: 254

    -remove-overpopulated-features
                      Removes all features that have reached the maximum allowed
                      amount of locations per feature. This can improve querying
                      speed and can be used to remove non-discriminative
                      features.
                      default: on

    -remove-ambig-features <rank>
                      Removes all features that have more distinct reference
                      sequence on the given taxonomic rank than set by
                      '-max-ambig-per-feature'. This can decrease the database
                      size significantly at the expense of sensitivity. Note
                      that the lower the given taxonomic rank is, the more
                      pronounced the effect will be.
                      Valid values: sequence, form, variety, subspecies,
                      species, subgenus, genus, subtribe, tribe, subfamily,
                      family, suborder, order, subclass, class, subphylum,
                      phylum, subkingdom, kingdom, domain
                      default: off

    -max-ambig-per-feature <#>
                      Maximum number of allowed different reference sequence
                      taxa per feature if option '-remove-ambig-features' is
                      used.

    -max-load-fac <factor>
                      maximum hash table load factor;
                      This can be used to trade off larger memory consumption
                      for speed and vice versa. A lower load factor will improve
                      speed, a larger one will improve memory efficiency.
                      default: 0.800000


ADVANCED: PERFORMANCE TUNING / TESTING

    -threads <#>      Sets the maximum number of parallel threads to use.default
                      (on this machine): 16


    -batch-size <#>   Process <#> many queries (reads or read pairs) per thread
                      at once.
                      default (on this machine): 4096

    -query-limit <#>  Classify at max. <#> queries (reads or read pairs) per
                      input file. and 
                      default: 9223372036854775807


EXAMPLES

    Query all sequences in 'myreads.fna' against pre-built database 'refseq':
        rnacache query refseq myreads.fna -out results.txt

    Query all sequences in multiple files against database 'refseq':
        rnacache query refseq reads1.fna reads2.fna reads3.fna

    Query all sequence files in folder 'test' againgst database 'refseq':
        rnacache query refseq test

    Query multiple files and folder contents against database 'refseq':
        rnacache query refseq file1.fna folder1 file2.fna file3.fna folder2

    Load database in interactive query mode, then query multiple read batches
        rnacache query refseq
        reads1.fa reads2.fa -pairfiles -insertsize 400
        reads3.fa -pairseq -insertsize 300


OUTPUT FORMAT

    RNACache's default read mapping output format is:
    read_header | seq_name

    Note that the separator '\t|\t' can be changed to something else with
    the command line option '-separator <text>'.
